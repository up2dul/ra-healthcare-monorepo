# ra-healthcare

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, React Router, Express, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **React Router** - Declarative routing for React
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Express** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Initialize hooks: `pnpm run prepare`
- Format and lint fix: `pnpm run check`
